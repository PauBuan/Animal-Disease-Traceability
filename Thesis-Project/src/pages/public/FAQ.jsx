      question: "What is Hyperledger Fabric?",
      answer: "Hyperledger Fabric is a 'permissioned' blockchain framework. Unlike public cryptocurrencies, it is a private system. In Santa Rosa, only authorized personnel—like the City Veterinarian and Barangay Health Officers—can record or verify data, ensuring that every record is backed by an official signature."
    },
    {
      question: "How does Blockchain help in Animal Traceability?",
      answer: "Every time a livestock record is created or updated, it is 'hashed' and stored across a ledger that cannot be altered or deleted. This creates an untamperable audit trail, meaning the history of a cow from Dila or a hog from Sinalhan is permanent and verifiable."
    },
    {
      question: "Why not use a regular database?",
      answer: "Standard databases can be edited or wiped. With Hyperledger, even a system administrator cannot secretly change a transaction once it is finalized. This builds absolute trust between our 18 barangays and the city government."
    },
    {
      question: "Which animals are tracked in Santa Rosa?",
      answer: "Our system currently monitors Hogs, Cows, Chickens, Carabaos, Goats, and Ducks. We track their movement from local farms to the City Slaughterhouse to ensure they are healthy before reaching the public market."
    },
    {
      question: "How is the health status verified?",
      answer: "Animals are tagged with a status: Healthy, Sick, or Unverified. If an animal is flagged as 'Sick' in a barangay like Aplaya, the system immediately locks its record, preventing it from being 'cleared' for slaughter until a City Vet uploads a new health certification."
